Kiagna River was first explored by prospectors who ascended the stream from Chitina River, about 1904, after gold had been discovered on Dan and Chititu creeks. They staked ground but seem to have done little mining. In 1906, or possibly 1905, James Barkley and J. B. Miller crossed the ice field between Yakataga beach and Granite Creek and made their way to the head of the Kiagna. They saw evidence that the Native Americans knew this route to the coast and they found the stakes of the former prospectors on the Kiagna. After a short stay, they returned to Yakataga by the route over which they had come. In 1907, Barkley, accompanied by William Jefferies, made the trip again. This time, they went around the east end of Granite Creek, and, instead of going back to Yakataga, they descended the Chitina and Copper rivers to the coast. Subsequently, others visited the district from time to time. In the fall and winter of 1914-15, there was a miniature stampede to the district. The men who took part in it found little to encourage them and abandoned the field.
